Creates a quick search toggle powered by search aggregator such as prowlarr. Searches results are embedded in a floating window, so no need to switch tabs/windows to view them.  Searches can be conducted on numerous supported sites. On any page that corresponds to a single title

We can also customize results by filtering indexers that we don't want, or we can do a whitelist and only add indexer we want. Additionally on tracker sites we are also able to filter results from the current site. 

The toggle shrinks when not in use, and can be moved around if desired
